# tbp.plot

This is a visualization tool for plotting [tbp.monty](https://github.com/thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty) visualizations.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)

## Installation

To use the tool, all you need to do is clone this repository. If you intend to do development on this repository, see the [Development](#development) section for the development setup.

### Install `uv`

On a Mac, `brew install uv` is sufficient. For other platforms, see the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates a virtual environment in `.venv/` and installs package dependencies as well as the `plot` console script.

## Usage

After installation you can run the following command to list all available plots:

```bash
$ uv run plot

Available plots:

  interactive_objects_evidence_over_time: Interactive visualization for objects, MLH and sensor locations
```

To run one of the available plots, run:

```bash
$ uv run plot interactive_objects_evidence_over_time [args]
```

For a list of plot-specific args, use the help menu with:

```bash
$ uv run plot interactive_objects_evidence_over_time [-h|--help]

usage: plot interactive_objects_evidence_over_time [-h] [--objects_mesh_dir OBJECTS_MESH_DIR] [-lm LEARNING_MODULE] experiment_log_dir

Arguments for plot 'interactive_objects_evidence_over_time'

positional arguments:
  experiment_log_dir    The directory containing the experiment log with the detailed stats file.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --objects_mesh_dir OBJECTS_MESH_DIR
                        The directory containing the mesh objects.
  -lm, --learning_module LEARNING_MODULE
                        The name of the learning module (default: "LM_0").

```


## Development

> [!NOTE]
> First, **make a fork of this repository**. Make any changes on your local fork. This repository is configured to only accept pull requests from forks.

The development of this project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), "a single tool to replace `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, `twine`, `virtualenv`, and more." You will need to install it.

We use `uv` as it tracks the latest PEP standards while relying on existing infrastructure like `pip`, `venv`, etc.

`uv.lock` is non-standard in Python, but as Python does not yet define a lockfile standard, any lockfile format is non-standard. The benefit of `uv.lock` is that it is cross-platform and "captures the packages that would be installed across all possible Python markers such as operating system, architecture, and Python version". This makes it safe to check-in to the repository.

### Adding new plots

Plots live under `src/tbp/plot/plots`. Each plot module defines two things:
1. **A main function** decorated with `@register`, which is the plot entry point.
2. **An optional add_arguments function** decorated with `@attach_args`, which defines the plot's CLI argparse arguments.

```python
# src/tbp/plot/plots/my_new_plot.py
import argparse
from tbp.plot.registry import register, attach_args

@register("my_new_plot", description="Example of a new plot")
def main(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> int:
    print(f"Running my_new_plot with arg1={arg1} and arg2={arg2}")
    # your plotting logic here...
    return 0

@attach_args("my_new_plot")
def add_arguments(p: argparse.ArgumentParser) -> None:
    p.add_argument("--arg1", required=True, help="The first argument.")
    p.add_argument("--arg2", type=int, default=100, help="The second argument.")
```

Once you add this file, it will be auto-discovered.

```bash
$ uv run plot

Available plots:

  interactive_objects_evidence_over_time: Interactive visualization for objects, MLH and sensor locations
  my_new_plot                           : Example of a new plot

$ uv run plot my_new_plot --arg1 "test" --arg2 50
Running my_new_plot with arg1=test and arg2=50
```

### Running Development Tools

All development tools can be run through `uv run`:

```bash
uv run ruff check        # lint & style
uv run ruff format       # auto-format
uv run deptry src tests  # dependency checks
uv run mypy              # type checks
uv run pytest            # run tests
```

To build the package:

```bash
uv build
```
